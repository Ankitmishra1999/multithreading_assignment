    "    Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process.\n",
    "    A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process, \n",
    "    and multithreading allows you to run multiple threads concurrently to perform tasks concurrently or in parallel.\n",
    "    Each thread has its own program counter, stack, and local variables,\n",
    "    but they share the same memory space of the parent process, which can be both an advantage and a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python for several purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: It allows you to perform multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking the main program's execution.\n",
    "This can be beneficial for tasks that involve I/O operations, like reading and writing to files or making network requests, \n",
    "as threads can work on these tasks concurrently while the main program continues to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: In Python, because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), true multi-core parallelism is limited. \n",
    "However, for certain types of tasks (e.g., CPU-bound tasks), you can still achieve some degree of parallelism by using threads,\n",
    "even if they don't fully utilize multiple CPU cores due to the GIL.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The module commonly used to handle threads in Python is the threading module.\n",

    "improving the overall program performance by utilizing available CPU resources more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Responsiveness: Multithreaded programs can be more responsive to user input, \n",

    "where multiple threads access and modify data simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable and erroneous behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Deadlocks: Poorly managed synchronization can lead to deadlocks,\n",
    "where threads are stuck waiting for resources that are held by other threads,\n",
